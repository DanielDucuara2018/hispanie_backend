class Account(Base, Resource):
    """Represents an account in the system, managing user credentials, contact information, and related entities.

    Attributes:
        id (str): A unique identifier for the account, generated using the `idun` utility.
        username (str): The username of the account holder. Uniqueness to be enforced.
        email (str): The email address associated with the account. Must be unique.
        phone (str | None): The phone number of the account holder, optional.
        type (AccountType): The type of account, either "user" or "admin".
        _password (bytes): The hashed password for the account, stored securely.

    Relationships:
        events (list[Event]): A list of events created by this account. Cascade delete enabled.
        businesses (list[Business]): A list of businesses associated with this account. Cascade delete enabled.
        files (list[File]): A list of files uploaded by this account. Cascade delete enabled.

    Properties:
        password (bytes): Getter for the hashed password.
        password (str): Setter for the password, which hashes the input string before storage.

    Notes:
        - Passwords are securely hashed using the `generate_password_hash` utility.
        - The `email` field is enforced as unique, and error handling for uniqueness violations is expected in application logic.
        - The `username` field's uniqueness should also be validated.
        - The `type` field categorizes the account as either a regular user or an admin.

    Usage:
        account = Account(username="johndoe", email="john@example.com", type=AccountType.USER)
        account.password = "securepassword123"  # Automatically hashes the password
